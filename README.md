## Self-Reflection:
It was difficult in terms of how many things and details are in a game but it was interesting and fun to do. I just had trouble seeing the actual game for some reason as the live server was on but it was not showing anything that i did. the code was just like the video so i was confused on why that was.

it took about 5 hours to do.
